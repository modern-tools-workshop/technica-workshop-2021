    "## Introduction\n",
    "Today we will look at the sea surface temperature (SST) variable from the [NOAA Extended Reconstructed SST version 5 dataset (ERSST)](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.ersst.v5.html). This dataset shows the global monthly mean ocean surface temperature from 1854-present using data collected from ocean buoys, ships, and climate modeled data. This data can be used for climate research and monitoring for El Nino/La Nina.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Where to access satellite data\n",
    "List of many gridded climate datasets distributed by NOAA: https://www.psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/ Today, we'll use [netcdf](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetCDF) files. These are structured binary files so they can store large data in a small format. They also have lots of metadata/attribute tags so we can learn information about the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can access the data directly using [Open-source Project for a Network Data Access Protocol (OPeNDAP)](https://www.opendap.org/), which simplifies access. Instead of downloading and reading data into Python, we can access it directly using a URL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I am writing out the url for the data. You can also browse the catalog after the tutorial to discover other interesting data! "
